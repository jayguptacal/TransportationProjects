<h1> Brief Introduction About The Energy Statistics Project</h1>
<p>While the data for this project has been sourced from Kaggle from the below link, it was originally provided by the United Nations Statistics, a division of</br>
<p>the UN Data site department (source credit: http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx).</p>

<h3>Data Source</h3>: https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/international-energy-statistics

<p>This data is very exhaustive in terms of commodity usage across various countries. For the purpose of this project, I will focus on finding out the energy<br/> 
  consumption of mainly crude oil production, imports and alternative energy resources for the countries popularly known as G7. </p>

<p>The focus of this exercise is to extract the information and the insights and present it via charts and bar graphs for the G7 countries.</p>
