<h1>Brief Introduction About The Energy Statistics Project</h1>

While the data for this project has been sourced from Kaggle from the below link, it was originally provided by 
the United Nations Statistics, a division of the UN Data site department (source credit: http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx).

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/international-energy-statistics

This data is very exhaustive in terms of commodity usage across various countries. For the purpose of this project, 
I will focus on finding out the energy consumption of mainly crude oil production, imports and alternative energy 
resources for the countries popularly known as G7.

The focus of this exercise is to extract the information and the insights and present it via charts and bar graphs 
for the G7 countries.
